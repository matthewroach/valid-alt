			This left me thinking, this only provides insight into examples of
			when the `alt` attribute is missing altogther, but what about use
			cases for examples in React when the alt text is present and not
			containing any information.	Yes, you are correct in saying this
			is a valid use case if the image is for decorative, but what about
			the cases where you are	using a component that is setup to output
			the value based on a property passed in from another component.
			We can also provide insight into images that are on the page that
			have an alt attribute but does not contain a value. By adding a
			small helper in our CSS we can provide a user with a "warning" of
			images that have alt but no value, so they are able to quicky see
			if that's correct behaviour for a given image.
		</p>

		<p>
			By providing a warning style, below you will see an orange border
			around images that have an alt attribute but no value we can quickly
			identify what is known as decorative images, and then see if they are
			all decorative images.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example in a web application where a developer is using a utility
			function to display and image/graphic and assumes the alt text is
			being set based on them passing a value, or even if they are just
			passing an object of data from a API or other datasource. Example
			of a CMS, where the UI is built in React and you just pass the
			image data from the API into your component - the issue here is you
			are hoping the admin/editor added the alt text in the photo/media
			library tool.
		</p>

		<p>
			See the example below, showing how the utility function is set up so
			the alt value defaults to a blank string. If an API key is missing this
			accounts for that and will not cause issues.

		<h3>Code Example</h3>
		<pre>
			<code>
// Simple Image Component
const Image = ({src, alt=""}) => &lt;img src={src} alt={alt} /&gt;


// example payload from an API/Datasource
const imageObject = {
	src: 'https://picsum.photos/id/233/200/200',
	alt: '',
};

// Passing the payload straight to the component for rendering
&lt;Image {...imageObject} /&gt;</code>
		</pre>

		<h3>CSS</h3>

		<pre>
			<code>
// Error - missing alt
img:not([alt]) {
	border: 5px solid rgb(255, 0, 0);
}

// Warning - Has alt attribute but no text value
img[alt=''] {
	border: 5px solid rgb(255, 165, 0);
}</code></pre>
